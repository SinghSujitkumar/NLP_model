# Overview
1. A machine learning system which can identify the nature and category of the complaint posted by the user.
2. This system is needed by a non-profit organization to improve their existing system where they were manually categorizing the complaints posted by the user. 

# Methodology
1. Feature Engineering is applied  to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. 
2. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
3. Using graphs it was found that data is highly  imbalanced , To have imbalanced data in our case is of  great interest since it is desirable to have a classifier that gives high prediction accuracy over the majority class while maintaining reasonable accuracy for the minority classes.
4. Used different machine learning models the accuracy was noted :
   - Linear SVC 0.947462 
   - LogisticRegression 0.947942 
   - MultinomialNB 0.936428 
   - RandomForestClassifier 0.788532
